1. Problem Statement

Private schools struggle with:
	•	Fragmented systems for leads, admissions, enrollment, and tuition
	•	Manual follow-ups and missed admissions opportunities
	•	Parent frustration with paper forms, clunky portals, and unclear billing
	•	Legacy SIS platforms that are expensive, slow to change, and hard to use

Schools want:
	•	One clean system from first inquiry → enrolled → paid
	•	Less admin work
	•	A parent experience that feels modern and trustworthy

⸻

2. Product Vision

“From first inquiry to tuition paid—without spreadsheets, PDFs, or duct tape.”

We will build a modern, admissions-first school management platform that:
	•	Nails the front door (leads, enrollment, payments)
	•	Is fast to adopt (weeks, not months)
	•	Grows into a full SIS without forcing schools to switch later
