1. Pricing Psychology for a 500-Student Private School

Private schools buy risk reduction, not software. Your pricing must signal:
	•	Stability
	•	Fairness
	•	Professionalism
	•	“We won’t surprise you”

Core Psychological Realities (Private Schools)
	1.	They hate nickel-and-diming
	•	Add-on fatigue is a real trauma (FACTS, Blackbaud).
	2.	Per-student pricing feels fair
	•	Aligns with enrollment changes.
	3.	Predictability > cheap
	•	Schools prefer “known annual cost” over “lowest price”.
	4.	Parents are indirectly part of the decision
	•	Anything that feels exploitative toward parents is a red flag.

Recommended Pricing Model

Primary Model: Per-Student, Annual Contract

Anchor price:
$55 / student / year

500 students → $27,500 ARR

Why this works:
	•	Sits comfortably below “enterprise” fear threshold
	•	High enough to signal seriousness
	•	Easy mental math for school boards

⸻

Packaging Strategy (Simple, Trust-Building)

One Core Plan (Strong Signal)

“Core School Platform”
	•	Admissions
	•	Enrollment
	•	Billing & payments
	•	Parent portal
	•	Email communication
	•	Support & onboarding

No tiers at launch.

This communicates:

“We’re not trying to trap you. This is the product.”

Optional Add-ons (Only 2–3, Clearly Justified)

Add-ons should feel like operational upgrades, not feature locks.

Add-on
Price Psychology
SMS Messaging
Pass-through + small platform fee
Financial Aid Module
Per aided student or flat
Advanced Analytics
Admin-only, premium


	Avoid:
	•	Charging parents for app access
	•	Charging for “basic” features like portals or reports
	•	Artificial limits (emails/month, users, roles)

⸻

Price Framing on the Website

How to Present It

Avoid:
	•	Monthly SaaS framing
	•	Feature-by-feature pricing tables

Use instead:

“One predictable annual cost.”

$55 per enrolled student
Includes onboarding, support, and all core features.

Add a board-friendly translation:

“For a 500-student school, that’s about $27,500 per year—less than one part-time admin role.”

This comparison resonates deeply with heads of school.

⸻

Discount Psychology (Use Sparingly)
	•	Multi-year commitment: 5–10%
	•	Founding schools: flat grandfathered rate
	•	No coupons, no flash sales

You want to feel like:

“A long-term partner, not a SaaS startup.”
