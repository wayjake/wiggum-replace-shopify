## Executive Summary

**The Problem**: Private schools are trapped between expensive enterprise platforms (Blackbaud at $20-28K+) and frustrating legacy systems (FACTS/RenWeb with 2.3/5 customer satisfaction). Both require months of implementation and nickel-and-dime schools for basic features.

**Our Opportunity**: A modern, admissions-first platform at $27,500/year for 500 students that:
- Sets up in **weeks, not months**
- Includes everything schools need (no add-on fees)
- Provides a parent experience that doesn't embarrass administrators
- Grows with schools without forcing painful migrations

## The Competitive Landscape

### Tier 1: Enterprise Players (Overkill for 500-Student Schools)

#### Blackbaud
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Pricing** | $20,000-$28,000+/year (entry point, grows over time) |
| **Target** | Larger independent schools with $40K+ tuition |
| **Implementation** | Months of setup, significant IT involvement |
| **Strengths** | Comprehensive suite, fundraising integration |
| **Weaknesses** | Expensive, complex, overkill for smaller schools |

> "Larger schools with a stable student base can typically afford the product. Smaller schools would need to be well-financed to afford it." — TrustRadius

**Why we win**: Blackbaud is "enterprise software" that assumes you have dedicated IT staff. A 500-student school with 1 business manager and 2 admissions staff doesn't need (or want) that complexity.

---

#### PowerSchool
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Pricing** | Custom (reports of being "most expensive" option) |
| **Target** | Districts, charter networks, large private schools |
| **Implementation** | Weeks to months |
| **Strengths** | Feature-rich, highly customizable |
| **Weaknesses** | Expensive, "may not be cost appropriate for particularly small schools" |

> "Fantastic for most schools, may not be cost appropriate for particularly small schools." — Capterra Review

**Why we win**: PowerSchool was built for districts and retrofitted for private schools. Their UX reflects that public-school DNA—cluttered, bureaucratic, not parent-friendly.

---

### Tier 2: Legacy Private School Players (Our Direct Competitors)

#### FACTS (includes RenWeb/FACTS SIS)
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Pricing** | Starting at $1,000 + parent fees ($45/year + 2.95% credit card) |
| **Market** | 12,000+ schools, primarily private/faith-based |
| **Customer Rating** | **2.3/5** on PissedConsumer (61 reviews) |
| **Implementation** | Varies; legacy systems are tedious to configure |

**The FACTS Problem—In Their Own Customers' Words:**

**On User Experience:**
> "I've used this software for ten years, and teacher experience is absolutely horrible. You must visit several screens and mouse around to add assignments or grades/comments."

> "Setting up the grade book is a tedious task, and it has to be done over and over. Grading is mouse-heavy and miserable. It's only better than a paper grade book."

> "My overall experience has been negative. It has grown on me, but they have just missed too many opportunities to make the system smooth. Instead, there are too many clicks necessary to complete basic tasks."

**On Parent Experience:**
> "Unjustified $41 enrollment fee charged to the payer side... recharged again every year."

> "This company will harass your phone line. I hope private schools find a better service because this is total garbage."

> "I made a payment, the funds were there, but I was charged for insufficient funds. Getting hold of their customer service is next to impossible."

**On Customer Service:**
> "HORRIBLE customer service which got worse when their call center was switched out of the United States." (Also mentioned for TADS)

> "The customer service is not the greatest. Luck out if you get someone polite and helpful. Otherwise, they just direct you to the learning page."

**On Privacy:**
> "Could not delete my personal private data from their system."

**Why we win against FACTS:**
1. **Modern UX**: Our interface is built for 2025, not 2005
2. **No parent fees**: Parents don't pay $45/year or 2.95% to use our system
3. **Unified system**: Admissions, enrollment, and billing in one platform (FACTS SIS and Tuition Management are separate)
4. **Fast setup**: Weeks, not months of tedious configuration
5. **Real support**: We onboard you with white-glove service

---

#### TADS (by VenturEd Solutions)
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Pricing** | Not publicly disclosed |
| **Focus** | Tuition management, financial aid, billing |
| **Strengths** | Good financial aid workflows |
| **Weaknesses** | TADS holds funds (delays to schools), mixed customer service reviews |

> "HORRIBLE customer service which got worse when their call center was switched out of the United States."

> "I find it very easy to use... However, not sure if parents have an easy time. I get many calls from parents."

**Why we win**: TADS is strong on financial aid but weak on admissions. We nail the entire front door—from first inquiry to tuition paid.

## Pricing Analysis: The Real Cost to Schools

### FACTS: The Hidden Costs

**School costs:**
- Platform fee: Starting at $1,000+
- Various add-ons priced separately (SIS vs. Tuition Management vs. Financial Aid)

**Parent costs (passed through or absorbed by school):**
- Annual enrollment fee: $45/family
- Credit card fee: 2.95% per transaction
- NSF/returned payment fees: $30+

**For a 500-student school** (assuming ~400 households):
- If school absorbs parent fees: $45 × 400 = $18,000/year additional cost
- If parents pay: 400 frustrated families who blame the school

### Blackbaud: Enterprise Pricing

- Starting at ~$20,000/year
- Grows to $28,000+ after 3 years
- Best for schools with $40K+ tuition who can absorb the cost

### Our Pricing: Predictable and Fair

**$55/student/year = $27,500 for 500 students**

Includes:
- Admissions CRM
- Applications & enrollment
- Payments & billing
- Parent portal
- Email communications
- Support & onboarding

**No hidden fees. No parent fees. One predictable annual cost.**

> "For a 500-student school, that's about $27,500 per year—less than one part-time admin role."

This comparison resonates deeply with heads of school making budget decisions.

## The Parent Experience Problem

### Why This Matters More Than Vendors Admit

Private school parents are:
- Paying $15,000-$40,000/year in tuition
- Professionals who use modern software daily
- Judging the school by every interaction

When parents struggle with a clunky portal or get hit with unexpected fees, **they blame the school**, not the vendor.

### The FACTS Parent Experience

> "This company has been horrible for years. Demands auto withdrawal, will not allow you to remove your account information."

> "I made a payment, the funds were there, but I was charged for insufficient funds. Getting hold of their customer service is next to impossible and you get the run around."

> "This place is worthless charges 30 fees before the 345 payment every month dual charges messed up my 1st payment charged me double."

### Our Parent Experience Promise

- **Clean, modern interface** that doesn't embarrass administrators
- **No parent fees** for using the system
- **Mobile-friendly** (60%+ of parents access on phones)
- **Clear billing** with no jargon ("You owe $4,550 due Sept 1")
- **One-click auto-pay** that actually works

---

## Sales Objections and Responses

### "We've been using FACTS for 10 years"

**Response**: That's exactly why you should look at alternatives. FACTS was built in a different era. Your admissions team is still working with spreadsheets because FACTS SIS and Tuition Management don't talk to each other properly. Your parents are frustrated with a dated portal. And you're paying extra fees every year that you don't have to.

### "Blackbaud is the industry standard"

**Response**: Blackbaud is fantastic for large schools with dedicated IT staff and $40,000+ tuition. For a 500-student school with a lean team, it's like buying a Ferrari to drive to the grocery store. We're built for schools like yours—modern features without the enterprise complexity.

### "Switching is too risky"

**Response**: The risk is staying with a system that frustrates your parents and drains your staff's time. We offer:
- 30-day pilot period
- White-glove onboarding (we do the heavy lifting)
- Data migration support
- Parallel running if you need it

### "Your company is too new"

**Response**: Every vendor was new once—including FACTS and Blackbaud. What matters is:
1. Does the product work? (Yes, and it's modern)
2. Is the company funded and committed? (Yes)
3. Can we prove it with references? (Yes)

We'll connect you with pilot schools who switched from FACTS.

## Go-To-Market Messaging

### Positioning Statement

**For** private K-12 schools with 300-800 students
**Who** struggle with fragmented systems, manual follow-ups, and parent-frustrating portals

**That** takes families from first inquiry to tuition paid without spreadsheets or duct tape
**Unlike** FACTS and Blackbaud, which are either dated or overpriced
**We** are fast to adopt, fair in pricing, and built for the parent experience

### Key Messages

1. **"Live in weeks, not semesters."**
   - Setup in 2-4 weeks vs. 4-6 months

   - No separate products for admissions, enrollment, billing

3. **"Parents will actually like it."**

   - $55/student includes everything

### Marketing Focus Areas

| Pain Point | Our Message |
|------------|-------------|
| Missed admissions follow-ups | "Never lose a lead again" |
| Paper-based re-enrollment | "90% of families complete enrollment without admin intervention" |
| Confusing billing | "Payments that feel like Stripe, not accounting software" |
| Implementation fear | "Live before your next board meeting" |

## Summary: The Knockout Punch

**When selling against FACTS to a 500-student school:**

1. **Lead with parent experience**: "Your parents are paying $20,000+ in tuition and getting hit with $45 enrollment fees plus 2.95% on every credit card payment. That frustration reflects on your school."

2. **Show the unified system**: "Right now, your admissions team uses spreadsheets because FACTS SIS doesn't really talk to Tuition Management. We're one system from inquiry to paid."

3. **Emphasize speed**: "FACTS implementations drag on for months. We get you live in weeks—before your next board meeting."

4. **Close on total cost**: "Add up what you're paying FACTS plus the parent fees you're absorbing or passing through. We're $27,500/year all-in. No surprises."
