Visual Trust System: Colors & Google Fonts

**Brand: EnrollSage** — "Wise guidance for enrollment journeys"

You are designing for:
	•	Heads of school
	•	Business managers
	•	Parents aged 35–60
	•	An industry allergic to "startup vibes"

Visual Principles

Your site should feel:
	•	Calm & Wise (like sage advice)
	•	Grounded & Natural (like the sage herb)
	•	Established & Trustworthy
	•	Quietly modern

Not:
	•	Playful
	•	Trendy
	•	Loud
	•	"Edtech blue gradients"

Color System (Sage-Inspired Trust Palette)

Primary Color: Sage Green

Use for headers, nav, CTAs, key actions
	•	Hex: #5B7F6D
	•	Signals: wisdom, growth, natural calm
	•	Feels grounded, professional, and approachable

This color evokes:
	•	The wisdom of sage advice
	•	Natural growth and guidance
	•	Calm, considered decisions
	•	Trustworthy stewardship

⸻

Secondary Color: Deep Forest

Use for text, dark accents, emphasis
	•	Hex: #2D4F3E
	•	Signals: depth, stability, expertise
	•	Anchors the lighter sage tones

Provides visual hierarchy and gravitas.

⸻

Tertiary Color: Warm Sage

Use for highlights, secondary CTAs, hover states
	•	Hex: #8AA896
	•	Signals: approachability, openness
	•	Softens the palette for friendly touches

⸻

Backgrounds: Sage Cream (Critical)

Pure white feels:
	•	Techy
	•	Cold
	•	Fatiguing

Use instead:
	•	Hex: #F8F9F6 (primary background - subtle sage undertone)
	•	Secondary panels: #FFFFFF

This subtly signals:

"Natural. Trustworthy. Thoughtful."

⸻

Text Colors
	•	Primary text: #1E1E1E
	•	Secondary text: #5F6368
	•	Disabled/muted: #9AA0A6

High contrast = accessibility = trust.

⸻

Status Colors (Muted, Sage-Harmonious)
	•	Success: #5B7F6D (matches primary sage)
	•	Warning: #B8A044 (muted gold-sage)
	•	Error: #8B4444 (muted terracotta, not alarm red)

Colors harmonize with the sage palette.

⸻

Google Fonts: Trust + Readability Combo

Headings: Libre Baskerville
	•	Serif
	•	Academic
	•	Timeless
	•	Used by publications and institutions

Use for:
	•	Page headers
	•	Section titles
	•	Pricing callouts

It signals:

“This is not experimental.”

⸻

Body & UI: Inter
	•	Clean
	•	Neutral
	•	Excellent at small sizes
	•	Industry standard for serious SaaS

Use for:
	•	Body copy
	•	Forms
	•	Tables
	•	Buttons

This pairing works because:
	•	Serif = authority
	•	Sans = clarity

Together they say:

“Established, but not outdated.”

⸻

Optional Alternative Pairing (More Traditional)

If you want even more old-school gravitas:
	•	Headings: Crimson Pro
	•	Body: Source Sans 3

This leans slightly more “independent school brochure”.

⸻

UI Styling Rules (Very Important)
	•	Rounded corners: 6–8px max
	•	Shadows: subtle, low elevation
	•	No glassmorphism
	•	No animated gradients
	•	No playful illustrations

Icons:
	•	Line icons only
	•	Consistent stroke width
	•	Avoid emoji-style icons

Buttons:
	•	Solid primary
	•	Secondary = outline
	•	No neon hover states

What This Communicates Instantly

Within 3 seconds, a visitor should feel:

“This company understands schools.”
“This won’t embarrass me in front of parents.”
“This looks stable enough to trust with tuition.”

That emotional response closes deals faster than features.
