Visual Trust System: Colors & Google Fonts

You are designing for:
	•	Heads of school
	•	Business managers
	•	Parents aged 35–60
	•	An industry allergic to “startup vibes”

Visual Principles

Your site should feel:
	•	Calm
	•	Established
	•	Neutral
	•	Quietly modern

Not:
	•	Playful
	•	Trendy
	•	Loud
	•	“Edtech blue gradients”

⸻

Color System (Trust-First Palette)

Primary Color: Deep Academic Navy

Use for headers, nav, anchors
	•	Hex: #1F2A44
	•	Signals: authority, permanence, competence
	•	Feels “school-like” without being childish

This color performs extremely well in:
	•	Finance
	•	Education
	•	Legal
	•	Healthcare

⸻

Secondary Color: Muted Evergreen

Use for accents, CTAs, success states
	•	Hex: #2F5D50
	•	Signals: growth, stewardship, responsibility
	•	Feels institutional, not “startup green”

Avoid neon or saturated greens.

⸻

Backgrounds: Warm Off-White (Critical)

Pure white feels:
	•	Techy
	•	Cold
	•	Fatiguing

Use instead:
	•	Hex: #F7F5F2 (primary background)
	•	Secondary panels: #FFFFFF

This subtly signals:

“Paper. Trust. Forms. Records.”

⸻

Text Colors
	•	Primary text: #1E1E1E
	•	Secondary text: #5F6368
	•	Disabled/muted: #9AA0A6

High contrast = accessibility = trust.

⸻

Status Colors (Muted)
	•	Success: #3A7F6B
	•	Warning: #C9A227 (muted gold, not orange)
	•	Error: #9C2F2F (brick red, not alarm red)

Avoid bright reds or greens.

⸻

Google Fonts: Trust + Readability Combo

Headings: Libre Baskerville
	•	Serif
	•	Academic
	•	Timeless
	•	Used by publications and institutions

Use for:
	•	Page headers
	•	Section titles
	•	Pricing callouts

It signals:

“This is not experimental.”

⸻

Body & UI: Inter
	•	Clean
	•	Neutral
	•	Excellent at small sizes
	•	Industry standard for serious SaaS

Use for:
	•	Body copy
	•	Forms
	•	Tables
	•	Buttons

This pairing works because:
	•	Serif = authority
	•	Sans = clarity

Together they say:

“Established, but not outdated.”

⸻

Optional Alternative Pairing (More Traditional)

If you want even more old-school gravitas:
	•	Headings: Crimson Pro
	•	Body: Source Sans 3

This leans slightly more “independent school brochure”.

⸻

UI Styling Rules (Very Important)
	•	Rounded corners: 6–8px max
	•	Shadows: subtle, low elevation
	•	No glassmorphism
	•	No animated gradients
	•	No playful illustrations

Icons:
	•	Line icons only
	•	Consistent stroke width
	•	Avoid emoji-style icons

Buttons:
	•	Solid primary
	•	Secondary = outline
	•	No neon hover states

What This Communicates Instantly

Within 3 seconds, a visitor should feel:

“This company understands schools.”
“This won’t embarrass me in front of parents.”
“This looks stable enough to trust with tuition.”

That emotional response closes deals faster than features.
