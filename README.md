## What is This?

This is a **live-coded educational project** created for social media, demonstrating how to build your own Shopify alternative using modern web technologies. Follow along as we construct a complete e-commerce storefront with payment processing, database management, and a beautiful UI.

## The Stack

- **[TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start)** - Full-stack React framework with SSR, server functions, and type-safe routing
- **[Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team)** + **[Turso](https://turso.tech)** - SQLite at the edge with a delightful developer experience
- **[Stripe](https://stripe.com)** - Payment processing that just works
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)** - Utility-first styling for rapid UI development

## How It Works

1. **Watch the content** - Follow along with the videos/streams where we build this step by step
2. **Clone and experiment** - Fork this repo and make it your own
3. **Deploy your store** - Host it on Vercel, Netlify, or wherever JavaScript runs

## What We're Building

A complete e-commerce platform featuring:

- 🛒 Product catalog with cart functionality
- 💳 Stripe checkout integration
- 📊 Dashboard for managing products and orders
- 🎨 Customizable storefront theming
- 🚀 Edge-deployed database for global performance
